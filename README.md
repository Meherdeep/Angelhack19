# Angelhack19 - IBM Call for code challenge
A smart convolutional neural network (CNN) that is trained on CCTV cameras and drones that brings the solution to the present problem. 

Once when I got stuck in a lift, I just lost my mind and I realised how important an evacuation plan is and you cant just go on panicking till the time you find a solution. 

So to create a proper evacuation plan from natural to man-made disasters, our system detects every thing that is vulnerable to everything that can cause severe damage.

To run the code, take the following steps:
1. Add the images of everything and anything that needs to be rescued to the folder JPEGImages
2. Use Labellmg for the image annotation 
3. Run TrainAndTest.py to get the trained model for the images
4. Run Webcam.py to see the detection through your laptop's webcam
5. Or you can run main.py to get detection using the drone vision or any remote camera
